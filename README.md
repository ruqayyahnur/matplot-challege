# Overall Analysis

- - From the data, I obseved the drug regimen used and which one was the most tested on the mice subjects. This drug was Capolmulin. There seemed to be an even split of female and meale mice subjects used. There was apositive correcaltion between the weight of the mouse and the average tumor Volume. The correlation reflected a correlation of 0.84.
